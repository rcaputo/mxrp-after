Problem:

	ChildRole augments BUILD, but its augmentor is never called.

main.pl

	creates a new Class object.

Class

	This is just a class that consumes a parameterized role, ChildRole.
	All the action happens in ParentRole and ChildRole.

ParentRole

	A wrapper around MooseX::Role::Parameterized.  It's a pared-down
	representation of a larger, real role.

	In the real context, it does more, but for now it should only behave
	exactly like MooseX::Role::Parameterized.  For the most part it
	does.

ChildRole

	Not strictly a child role, but I had to name it something.

	It uses ParentRole as an equivalent to MooseX::Role::Parameterized.

	When using ParentRole, it's C<after BUILD ....> augmentor is not
	called.

	The agumentor is called correctly when ChildRole uses
	MooseX::Role::Parameterized directly.
